## üéØ Key Patterns and Techniques

### 1. Two Pointers / Fast-Slow Pointers
**When to use:** Finding middle, detecting cycles, removing nodes from end
**Key Problems:** 
- Linked List Cycle (Floyd's Algorithm)
- Remove Nth Node From End
- Finding Middle of Linked List

**Template:**
```cpp
ListNode* slow = head;
ListNode* fast = head;
while (fast && fast->next) {
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;
}
```

### 2. Linked List Reversal
**When to use:** Reversing entire list or parts of it
**Key Problems:**
- Reverse Linked List
- Reverse Nodes in k-Group
- Palindrome Linked List

**Template:**
```cpp
ListNode* prev = nullptr;
ListNode* current = head;
while (current) {
    ListNode* next = current->next;
    current->next = prev;
    prev = current;
    current = next;
}
return prev;
```

### 3. Merge Technique
**When to use:** Combining sorted lists, reordering
**Key Problems:**
- Merge Two Sorted Lists
- Merge k Sorted Lists
- Sort List

**Template:**
```cpp
ListNode dummy(0);
ListNode* current = &dummy;
while (l1 && l2) {
    if (l1->val <= l2->val) {
        current->next = l1;
        l1 = l1->next;
    } else {
        current->next = l2;
        l2 = l2->next;
    }
    current = current->next;
}
current->next = l1 ? l1 : l2;
```

### 4. Hash Table for Complex Relationships
**When to use:** Random pointers, detecting intersections, avoiding duplicates
**Key Problems:**
- Copy List with Random Pointer
- Remove Duplicates from Unsorted List

### 5. Dummy Head Technique
**When to use:** Simplifying edge cases, especially when head might change
**Benefits:** Eliminates special handling for head node

```cpp
ListNode dummy(0);
dummy.next = head;
// Work with dummy.next
return dummy.next;
```

## üöÄ Advanced Techniques

### Floyd's Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare)
- **Use Case:** Detecting cycles in O(1) space
- **Principle:** Fast pointer gains one position per iteration on slow pointer
- **Extension:** Finding cycle start (Linked List Cycle II)

### Divide and Conquer
- **Use Case:** Merge k sorted lists, sorting linked lists
- **Advantage:** Reduces time complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(n log n)

### Space-Time Trade-offs
1. **Hash Table Approach:** O(n) space for O(1) lookup
2. **Two-Pass Algorithm:** O(1) space but requires multiple traversals
3. **Constant Space Tricks:** Modifying pointers cleverly (e.g., interweaving)

## üí° Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. Null Pointer Handling
```cpp
// Always check before accessing
if (fast && fast->next) {
    fast = fast->next->next;
}
```

### 2. Memory Management
```cpp
// Don't forget to delete removed nodes
ListNode* nodeToDelete = current->next;
current->next = nodeToDelete->next;
delete nodeToDelete;
```

### 3. Edge Cases to Consider
- Empty list (head = nullptr)
- Single node
- Two nodes
- Cycles in the list
- Lists of different lengths

### 4. Off-by-One Errors
- Finding middle: Use correct loop condition
- N-th node from end: Position fast pointer correctly

## üèóÔ∏è Problem-Solving Framework

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- What are the constraints?
- What should be returned?
- Are there special cases?

### Step 2: Identify the Pattern
- Two pointers?
- Reversal needed?
- Merge operation?
- Hash table for relationships?

### Step 3: Choose the Approach
- Optimize for time or space?
- Multiple approaches possible?
- Which is most suitable for interview?

### Step 4: Handle Edge Cases
- Null inputs
- Single/two node lists
- Cycles or special structures

## üî• Interview Tips

### Most Frequently Asked
1. **Reverse Linked List** - Master both iterative and recursive
2. **Merge Two Sorted Lists** - Foundation for many problems
3. **Linked List Cycle** - Floyd's algorithm is elegant
4. **Remove Nth Node** - Classic two-pointer problem

### What Interviewers Look For
1. **Clean Code:** Use dummy heads, meaningful variable names
2. **Edge Case Handling:** Show you think about corner cases
3. **Multiple Solutions:** Mention time/space trade-offs
4. **Optimization:** Can you improve the solution?

### Common Follow-ups
- "What if the list is doubly linked?"
- "Can you do it in O(1) space?"
- "How would you handle very large lists?"
- "What if there are memory constraints?"
